    <p class="paragraph1">Postgraduate education, graduate education, or grad school consists of academic or professional degrees, certificates, diplomas, or other qualifications usually pursued by post-secondary students who have earned an undergraduate (bachelor's) degree</p>
    
    <p class="paragraph2">The organization and structure of postgraduate education varies in different countries, as well as in different institutions within countries.[3] While the term "graduate school" or "grad school" is typically used in North America (Canada and the United States), "postgraduate" (or ‘post-graduate’) is often used in regions such as Australia, Bangladesh, India, Ireland, much of Latin America, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia and the United Kingdom.</p>
    
    <p class="paragraph3">Graduate degrees can include master's degrees, doctoral degrees, and other qualifications such as graduate diplomas, certificates and professional degrees. A distinction is typically made between graduate schools (where courses of study vary in the degree to which they provide training for a particular profession) and professional schools, which can include medical school, law school, business school, and other institutions of specialized fields such as nursing, speech–language pathology, engineering, or architecture. The distinction between graduate schools and professional schools is not absolute since various professional schools offer graduate degrees and vice versa.</p>
